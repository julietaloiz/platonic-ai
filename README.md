# Platonic

Platonic helps you explore philosophical and abstract topics through Socratic questioning. Instead of giving answers, Platonic guides you to think deeper and reflect on your own ideas.

## Project Status
This project is in early development. The first release will include:
- A simple web-based chat interface (Streamlit)
- An AI agent that only asks questions (never answers)
- Conversation history and running summary

## Contributing
Platonic is currently a solo learning project. Contributions are not open yet, but feedback and encouragement are welcome!

Stay tuned for updates as Platonic evolves into a unique tool for thoughtful exploration.
